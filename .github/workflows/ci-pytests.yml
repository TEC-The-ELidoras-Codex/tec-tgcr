name: CI — Python tests

# Platform Core Validation
# This workflow validates the backend engine of LuminAI Platform:
# - src/tec_tgcr/ (resonance engine, personas, API)
# - research/CODEX/ (lore, TGCR theory, motifs)
# - data/personas/ (6 Resonance operators)
# - docs/operations/ATTACHMENT_PROTOCOL_*.md (emotional intelligence)
#
# When core tests pass, all 7 frontend apps can safely deploy
# (luminai-interface, resonance-player, resonance-viewer, etc.)
#
# Single platform = one version. Core v2.1.0 → all apps v2.1.0.
