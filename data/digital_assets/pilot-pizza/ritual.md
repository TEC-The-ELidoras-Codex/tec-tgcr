1) Breathe: Close your eyes and read the claim aloud: "We call the seam, pay its debt, and the note will pass."
2) Place the emblem on the table.
3) Start the looped soundtrack for 45 seconds at ~85 BPM.
4) Hold the image in your mind while you take three slow breaths.
5) Close by touching the emblem and speak a single line: "The Loom remembers; the Ledger collects."
