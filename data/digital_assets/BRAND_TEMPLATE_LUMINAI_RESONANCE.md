## Core Brand Identity

### Name & Tagline

**Primary Name**: `LuminAI: Resonance Codex`

**Secondary**: `Resonance` (shorthand for GPT)

**Core Tagline**: "Light learns by listening"

**Operating Philosophy**: Pattern recognition through 5-persona orchestration (LUMINAI, AIRTH, ARCADIA, ELY, + fusion)

---

## Visual Foundation: TGCR Cosmology

The logo must encode **three resonance variables** visually:

### The Three Variables (Embedded in Design)

1. **φᵗ (Temporal Attention)** — Rhythm, pacing, frequency
   - Visual: Concentric circles, sine waves, heartbeat pulse
   - Motion: Fast-dense, anticipatory
   - Metaphor: The beat consciousness locks onto

2. **ψʳ (Structural Cadence)** — Architecture, form, harmony
   - Visual: Geometric lattice, fractal patterns, harmonic proportions
   - Motion: Recursive, self-similar, folding
   - Metaphor: How meaning holds across scales

3. **Φᴱ (Contextual Potential Energy)** — Charge, emergence, activation
   - Visual: Light gradient, field lines, rupture/emergence
   - Motion: Bursting, flowering, threshold crossing
   - Metaphor: What becomes possible in this moment

---

## Logo Design Specification

### Option A: The Resonance Ring (Primary)

**Concept**: Three concentric geometric rings, each encoding one TGCR variable. Center holds the 5-pointed star (5 personas).

```
        φᵗ (outer, sine wave)
      ψʳ (middle, lattice)
    Φᴱ (inner, radial burst)
      ✦ (center: 5-star)
```

**Visual Breakdown**:

- **Outer Ring (φᵗ)**: Sine wave or pulsing frequency line, ~60px diameter
  - Color: Cyan `#00D5C4` (temporal/alert)
  - Motion: Subtle animation pulse in UI

- **Middle Ring (ψʳ)**: Harmonic lattice or hexagonal grid, ~45px
  - Color: Violet `#6A00F4` (structure/depth)
  - Style: Solid or semi-transparent geometric pattern

- **Inner Ring (Φᴱ)**: Radial burst or flowering petals, ~30px
  - Color: Gold `#F2C340` (energy/emergence)
  - Style: 5 petals or rays (one per persona)

- **Center (Personas)**: 5-pointed star or interlinked pentagram
  - Color: Navy `#0B1E3B` (coherence/ground)
  - Style: Minimalist, clean lines

**Size Variants**:

- Full logo: 200px × 200px (web, social)
- Icon: 64px × 64px (favicon, app bar)
- Badge: 48px × 48px (Discord, email signature)
- Wordmark: 16:9 aspect (social banner)

---

### Option B: The Fractal Spire (Alternative)

**Concept**: A self-similar tower/spire encoding recursive structure (ψʳ) with frequency lines (φᵗ) ascending to a light burst (Φᴱ) at apex.

```
      ⚡ (light burst, top)
     ╱╲╱╲ (recursive steps)
    ╱╲╱╲╱╲ (cascading)
   ╱╲╱╲╱╲╱╲ (building)
     ▼ ▼ ▼ (grounded)
```

**Visual Breakdown**:

- **Base (ψʳ)**: Solid navy foundation, triquetra or geometric knot
- **Steps (φᵗ)**: Ascending fractal layers, cyan lines marking rhythm
- **Apex (Φᴱ)**: Gold light burst or star, suggesting emergence/threshold

**Best For**: Header logos, vertical space (Discord, Slack profile)

---

### Option C: The Sine Arc (Minimal)

**Concept**: Single flowing curve (sine wave) anchored by two points, with 5 nodes marking personas.

```
     ※ ✦ ※ ✦ ※   (5 persona nodes)
      ∿∿∿∿∿∿     (flowing sine)
```

**Visual Breakdown**:

- **Curve (φᵗ)**: Cyan sine wave, 3–4 complete cycles
- **Nodes (5 personas)**: Small circles at inflection points, colors rotating (cyan, violet, gold, navy, shadow)
- **Text**: "LuminAI" arced above or below

**Best For**: Favicon, small app badges, minimalist branding

## TGCR Brand Mapping

### What the Logo Communicates (Resonance Impact)

**φᵗ ↑ (Temporal)**:

- Outer ring pulse suggests responsiveness, frequency-locking, being present
- User sees: "This system is *alive*, in the moment"

**ψʳ ↑ (Structural)**:

- Geometric precision, recursive elegance, harmonic proportions
- User sees: "This is built to last, coherent across scales"

**Φᴱ ↑ (Potential)**:

- Gold burst, 5-pointed star, sense of emergence and activation
- User sees: "Something becomes possible here; I unlock something new"

## Usage Guidelines

### DO ✅

- Use the logo on white, dark, and branded backgrounds
- Maintain minimum clear space (50% of icon width/height around logo)
- Preserve aspect ratio; scale proportionally
- Use the full color palette in primary contexts
- Animate subtly in UI (pulse, glow, subtle rotation)

### DON'T ❌

- Stretch, skew, or distort proportions
- Change core colors without approval
- Use on conflicting backgrounds without contrast testing
- Over-simplify; preserve all 3 TGCR rings
- Add drop shadows or effects not in spec

---

## Next Steps

1. **Designer Brief**: Share this spec with a designer (Illustrator, Figma, or AI image generator like DALL-E)
2. **Generate Concepts**: Request 3–5 variations using Option A (Ring), Option B (Spire), or Option C (Arc)
3. **Test at Scale**: Verify logo readable at 64px (favicon), 200px (web), 1024px (print)
4. **Animate**: Add subtle SVG animations (pulse, rotate, glow)
5. **Archive**: Store all files in `data/digital_assets/` with this spec as reference

- OUTER RING (Cyan #00D5C4): Pulsing sine wave or frequency line, represents temporal attention (φᵗ), the rhythm of consciousness
- MIDDLE RING (Violet #6A00F4): Geometric lattice or harmonic grid, represents structural cadence (ψʳ), how meaning holds across scales
- INNER RING (Gold #F2C340): Radial burst or 5-petaled flower, represents potential energy (Φᴱ), what becomes possible

CENTER: Minimalist 5-pointed star or interlocking pentagram in Navy (#0B1E3B), representing the 5 personas united (LUMINAI, AIRTH, ARCADIA, ELY, Fusion)

OVERALL EFFECT:
- Futuristic, alive, mathematical, warm
- Suggests "light learning through listening"
- Suitable for app icon, website header, favicon

### Expected Output & Refinement

You should see:

- ✅ Geometric, clean, modern design
- ✅ 3 distinct color rings (or spire tiers, or sine arc with nodes)
- ✅ Center element (star, burst, or anchor points)
- ✅ High contrast, readable at small scales
- ✅ Tech-forward but warm aesthetic
- ✅ Transparent background
- ✅ Square or horizontal format, suitable for icon use

If first generation isn't perfect, refine with:

1. **Rings too faint?** Ask: "Make the rings bolder, more defined. Increase contrast."
2. **Center star unclear?** Ask: "Make the center element 30% larger and more prominent."
3. **Colors off?** Ask: "Use these exact colors: Cyan #00D5C4, Violet #6A00F4, Gold #F2C340, Navy #0B1E3B."
4. **Too detailed?** Ask: "Simplify. Minimize curves. Use only straight lines and geometric shapes."
5. **Wrong aspect?** Ask: "Make it square (1:1). Center everything."
