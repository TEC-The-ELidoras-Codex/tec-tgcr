## Integration with FOLD

Everything connects:

```
GitHub Project #6 (This Week's Work)
  ↓ tracks issues labeled with area/*, type/*, P0/P1/P2
  ↓ assigned to @LuminAI/@Airth/@Ely/@Kaznak (5 FOLD personas)
  ↓ commits use resonance statement format (φᵗ/ψʳ/Φᴱ)
  ↓ milestone: "Stable / MVP (March 6, 2026)" (FOLD timeline)
  ↓
FOLD Framework (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
  ↓ defines commit signals, personas, craft guidelines
  ↓ links to quick reference (docs/FOLD_QUICK_START.md)
  ↓ references music research (research/ALBUM_ANALYSIS/)
  ↓
Research Corpus (research/)
  ↓ populated based on project items
  ↓ motif tracker, resonance engine (future implementation)
  ↓
March 6, 2026 MVP (Public Launch)
  ↓ coordinated via GitHub Project #6
  ↓ all work tracked & visible
  ↓ release notes auto-generated from Done items
```
