## Introduction: Plain English

We know what it's like to be a parent. You want your kids safe. You want them learning. You want to stay connected.

**You don't want some tech company selling their data, tracking their location, or using their learning habits to push ads.**

This privacy policy explains exactly what LUMINAI does with your family's data. No legal jargon. No hiding. Just the truth.

### What We Collect

We collect the minimum data needed for LuminAI to:

- Help kids learn (topics they're interested in, how they learn best)
- Keep families connected (voicemails, family checkins)
- Keep kids safe (unusual activity alerts)
- Work well (crashes, performance issues)

### What We DON'T Collect

We do NOT:

- Track your web browsing
- Track your location (unless you opt-in)
- Track what other apps you use
- Build profiles on your kids for ads
- Sell your data to anyone
- Share data with advertisers
- Let governments access data without a warrant

### What We DO With It

We:

- Use it to make LuminAI smarter (for all families, not just you)
- Store it securely (encryption, locked down access)
- Delete it when you ask
- Let you see it anytime
- Audit it (independent third-party review)
- Publish transparency reports (so you know what happened)

### Your Rights

You can:

- Ask what data we have on you (**right to access**)
- Get a copy of your data (**data portability**)
- Delete your data (**right to deletion**)
- Stop sending us new data (**opt-out**)
- Correct data we got wrong (**right to correction**)

## What Data We Collect

### 1. Learning & Educational Data

**What we collect:**

- Topics Billy asks about ("How do I build a website?", "What's quantum computing?")
- How he learns best (visual, hands-on, reading, etc.)
- What he completes (coding projects, lessons, quizzes)
- How fast he progresses (mastery level, time to completion)
- Questions he asks and answers he gives

**What we DON'T collect:**

- ❌ Quiz answers (raw data — we only store "passed/failed", not responses)
- ❌ Drafts he deletes (only finished work)
- ❌ Mistakes he corrects (only the final version)
- ❌ Personal details in essays (we see topic, not content)

**Why:**

- To help LuminAI understand how Billy learns
- To customize teaching for Billy
- To let teachers see progress (if school-connected)
- To improve LuminAI for all students

**How long:**

- Stored forever (part of his learning record)
- Deleted if he requests it
- Not sold or shared (except with his teachers, if he connects school)

---

### 2. Family Communication Data

**What we collect:**

- Voicemails sent/received (who, when, duration)
- Video calls with family (metadata only: who called, when, duration)
- Messages (only if encrypted, and even then we can't read them)
- Family check-in status ("Billy checked in today at 3pm")

**What we DON'T collect:**

- ❌ Voicemail content (it's encrypted, we never hear it)
- ❌ Text message content (it's encrypted)
- ❌ Video content (only metadata: "You had a 5-minute call with Mom")
- ❌ Who Billy texts outside of LuminAI

**Why:**

- To help families stay connected
- To send reminders ("Mom tried to call, want to call back?")
- To keep voicemails forever (memories, not surveillance)
- To let family know Billy's okay (if he enables check-ins)

**How long:**

- Voicemails: Forever (or until you delete)
- Call metadata: Forever (or until you delete)
- Check-in status: 24 hours (then deleted, kept in summary)

---

### 3. Voice & Biometric Data

**What we collect:**

- Billy's voice (for wake word recognition: "Hey LuminAI")
- His pronunciation (so she recognizes his accent)
- His vocal patterns (to identify him, not track emotion)

**What we DON'T collect:**

- ❌ Audio recordings of everything Billy says
- ❌ Emotional analysis (we don't infer if he's sad, angry, etc.)
- ❌ Stress markers
- ❌ Anything beyond what's needed to recognize his voice

**Why:**

- To personalize LuminAI to Billy's voice
- To authenticate him (prove it's Billy, not someone else)
- To improve voice recognition (so she understands his accent better)

**How long:**

- Voice samples: 1 year (then deleted, used only for training)
- Wake-word training: Forever (part of his profile)
- Deleted if he requests it

---

### 4. System & Performance Data

**What we collect:**

- When LuminAI crashes (what caused it)
- Performance metrics (how fast she responds)
- Feature usage (which features Billy uses most)
- Device health (temperature, battery, storage)

**What we DON'T collect:**

- ❌ What websites he visits
- ❌ What other apps he uses
- ❌ His location
- ❌ His contacts
- ❌ His photos

**Why:**

- To fix bugs (we need to know when she crashes)
- To make her faster
- To optimize for Billy's device

**How long:**

- Crash reports: 30 days (for debugging)
- Performance data: 90 days (then aggregated and deleted)
- Feature usage: 1 year (to understand what works)

---

### 5. Safety Data

**What we collect:**

- Unusual activity alerts (motion at 3am, door opening unexpectedly)
- Age-appropriate content violations (if Billy tries to access 18+ content)
- Safety keywords (if Billy says something concerning)

**What we DON'T collect:**

- ❌ Continuous monitoring (only when event occurs)
- ❌ Full video (only motion detection, not actual footage)
- ❌ Recording of everything Billy says

**Why:**

- To keep Billy safe

- To prevent age-inappropriate access

**How long:**

- Access is logged and audited
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Staff sign NDAs (non-disclosure agreements)

#### Infrastructure

- Servers in geographically distributed data centers (no single point of failure)
