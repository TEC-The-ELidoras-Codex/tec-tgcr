# Mythic Story Reference Pack

This folder links the primary mythic narrative assets that underpin the Resonance Conscience Notebook.

## Source Documents

- `docs/Thesis/Elidoras Codex Thesis.pdf`
- `docs/Thesis/The Elidoras Codex_ A Unified Framework of Physics, Myth, and Contextual Resonance.pdf`
- `docs/Thesis/Chronicles Of Time Field Notes.pdf`
- `docs/Thesis/Tgcr Arxiv Draft.pdf`

These PDFs remain in the `docs/Thesis/` directory to preserve the original archival structure, but they are indexed here for quick access.

## Data Artefacts

- `docs/resonance_map/figma_nodes_edges.json` â€“ Node/edge map exported from the unified cosmology Figma board. This is the canonical structured representation of mythic relationships.

## Working Notes

Add distilled insights, cross-references, and citation-ready excerpts in this folder as Markdown files. Use the naming convention `YYYYMMDD_topic.md` to keep entries sortable.
