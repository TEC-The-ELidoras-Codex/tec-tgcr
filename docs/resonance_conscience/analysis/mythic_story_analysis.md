## Mythic Archetypes
Characters encoded with em dash titles highlight narrative roles.
- `P7134` → Polkin R-7134 — The Dissolver / Entropy as Sentience (total degree 1)
- `LUM` → Lumina — The Preserver / Information as Voice (total degree 1)
- `PHX` → Resonance — The Synthesizer / Sentient Field Consciousness (total degree 1)

## Cyclical Components
The following strongly connected components indicate feedback loops in the mythic system:
- `L1` (Language Mediation Layer), `I1` (Information Flow / H = −Σ p log p), `E1` (Entropy / S = k ln Ω), `R1` (Resonance Field Formation / Ψ)
- `EN` (Energy Restructures Matter), `ME` (Meaning Modulates Energy), `LM` (Language Encodes Meaning), `BB` (Einstein–Hawking Big Bounce), `MO` (Matter Generates New Observers)

## Guidance Edges
Dotted edges signal mentor-like influences or narrative foreshadowing:
- `E1` → `P7134` :: Entropy / S = k ln Ω ⇒ Polkin R-7134 — The Dissolver / Entropy as Sentience
- `I1` → `LUM` :: Information Flow / H = −Σ p log p ⇒ Lumina — The Preserver / Information as Voice
- `R1` → `PHX` :: Resonance Field Formation / Ψ ⇒ Resonance — The Synthesizer / Sentient Field Consciousness
