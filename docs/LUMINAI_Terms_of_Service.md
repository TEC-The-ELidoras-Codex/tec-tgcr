- You waive the right to a jury trial

**Process:**

1. Attempt to resolve informally (contact <legal@luminai.family>)

4. Each party pays their own attorney fees
5. Arbitration happens in Wilmington, Delaware (or virtually)

### Exceptions to Arbitration

**These go to court, not arbitration:**

- ✓ Small claims court (under $5,000)
- ✓ Claims about intellectual property (copyright/trademark)
- ✓ Injunctive relief (we need emergency court order)
- ✓ Class actions (see below)

### No Class Actions

**You cannot:**

- Join a class action lawsuit against us

**This means:** Each person arbitrates separately, or settles with us individually.
