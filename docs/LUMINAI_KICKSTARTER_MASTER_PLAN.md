## 🎬 THE STORY YOU'RE TELLING

Every piece of this campaign tells one story:

> **"Your kid deserves infrastructure built FOR her. Not ON her."**

- **Video**: Shows a kid who just wants her computer to be hers
- **Schematics**: Proves we built something real + transparent
- **Regulatory section**: Proves we understand the stakes
- **Encryption details**: Proves we prioritized her security
- **Upgrade path**: Proves we thought about her whole life
- **Open-source axioms**: Proves we're not just selling a product—we're starting a movement

Everything connects. Everything points to the same truth:

**This is not another startup selling kid data. This is an alternative.**

---

## 🙏 FINAL NOTES

You have everything you need to run a successful campaign. The documents are detailed, actionable, and tested against real Kickstarter patterns.

What you need to do now:

1. **Assign ownership**: Who owns video? Schematics? Campaign copy? GitHub? Set clear DRIs (directly responsible individuals).

2. **Set deadlines**: Use the roadmap above. Assign calendar dates. Weekly sync calls to track progress.

3. **Budget approval**: Get finance/investors to approve $37–78K for production. This is not optional—quality matters.

4. **Start production NOW**: Video is the longest pole in the tent. Start casting, location scouting, and shot planning immediately.

5. **Build team**: You'll need video crew, hardware engineers, graphic designers, copywriter, community manager. Hire or contract now.

6. **Track metrics**: Use the success criteria above. 30% of pledged amount on Day 1 is your North Star.
