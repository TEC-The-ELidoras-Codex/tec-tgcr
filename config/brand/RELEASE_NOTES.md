# Brand Release Notes — LuminAI Visuals

Release: 2025-11-05
Version: 1.0

This release declares the official canonical visuals for LuminAI. All files listed here are authoritative and should be used by design, product, and automated tooling.

Official assets added in this release:

- `config/brand/svg/LUMINAI_Infographic_US.svg` — Official Infographic (US)

Notes:

- These files are considered canonical only when stored in `config/brand/` and listed in `config/brand/BRAND_MANIFEST.yml` with `official: true`.
- If you have a higher-fidelity original for any of these files, replace the file at the same path and update the `provenance` metadata in both the SVG and `BRAND_MANIFEST.yml`.
- All SVGs must include `<title>` and `<desc>` for accessibility before being used in production.
