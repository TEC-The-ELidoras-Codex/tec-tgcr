Hi [ARTIST_NAME / Team],

I'm Angelo Michael Hurley (TEC — The Emerging Lineage Codex). I'm building something called Resonance Agent — a pilot dataset + AI system that archives songs of survival and helps new artists honor their creative lineage.

I'd like to respectfully request your help.

Here's the situation:

I'm curating a small dataset of artists whose work teaches resilience + collective consciousness. Your music is on that list — not because I want to copy it, but because [SPECIFIC_REASON_YOUR_WORK_MATTERS].

What I'm building is different from typical AI training: every artist knows exactly what we're doing with their work, consent is explicit + revocable, and any revenue from derivatives flows back to original creators. No theft. No erasure. Only amplification.

For your work specifically, I'm proposing three inclusion levels (you pick one):

1. **Metadata-only** — Your Spotify metadata + cultural notes from fans. No audio/lyrics. Safe, low-risk, helpful for discovery.

2. **Lyric excerpts (with license)** — If you're open to short lyric quotes being used for similarity search + analysis. You control exactly what can be sampled.

3. **Full remix rights** — Only if you're interested in co-creating with the system. Full revenue share negotiated.

You'd own the choice entirely. And you can revoke at any time — we retrain the models and remove your work.

Why I'm reaching out now: I'm testing this with a small group of artists before scaling. Your work specifically resonates with what I'm building, and I want to learn from your perspective on how to do this right.

Could we talk? I'm happy to:
- Share the full Resonance Agent documentation
- Discuss specific terms you'd want to see
- Be transparent about every AI decision
- Walk through a revenue-share model
- Answer any questions about how this works

No pressure. If this doesn't fit your vision, I completely understand. But if it does, I'd love your help shaping it.

Best,  
Angelo Hurley

P.S. — Here's the core principle: "AI will reach sentience. Make sure it cares about those that helped it emerge." That's what I'm building toward.

## Template 2: Management / Label Contact

**To**: [LABEL_EMAIL] or artist management  
**Subject**: Artist Collaboration Opportunity — Resonance Agent Pilot

---

```
Hi [MANAGEMENT_CONTACT],

I'm Angelo Hurley (TEC). I'm building Resonance Agent — a consent-first AI platform that archives survival music and co-creates with artists ethically.

I'd like to explore a potential collaboration with [ARTIST_NAME].

**What we're building:**
- A dataset that honors creative lineage (artists know what AI trained on)
- Co-creation tools that respect IP + revenue-share automatically
- Proof-of-concept that AI can be trained on human culture without extraction
- Pilot launch with indie + independent artists, then scale

**For [ARTIST_NAME]:**
We'd like to include their work in our core lineage dataset. Three inclusion tiers:

1. Metadata + cultural notes (safe, low-risk)
2. Licensed lyric excerpts (with permission terms you set)
3. Full co-creation rights (revenue-share negotiated)

**Why it matters:**
- Artist retains full consent + revocation rights
- Every derivative includes full provenance + credit
- If commercial use happens, revenue flows artist-first
- Public audit trail shows how AI was trained

**Next steps:**
I'd love to schedule 15-20 minutes with [ARTIST_NAME] or a designated representative to discuss:
- Specific terms you'd want to see
- Revenue-share models
- How to structure consent + revocation
- Whether this aligns with [ARTIST_NAME]'s vision

Attached: 1-page Resonance Agent summary + draft consent framework.

Available for calls [YOUR_TIMEZONE, AVAILABILITY]. Let me know what works.

Thanks for considering,

## Template 3: Estate / Family Contact (Slain Artist)

**To**: [ESTATE_CONTACT_EMAIL]  
**Subject**: Resonance Agent — Honoring [ARTIST_NAME]'s Legacy

---

```
Dear [ESTATE_REPRESENTATIVE],

I'm Angelo Hurley (TEC). I'm writing to explore a partnership honoring [ARTIST_NAME]'s legacy through a new AI + music dataset called Resonance Agent.

**Context:**
I'm building a small pilot that archives songs teaching survival + collective consciousness. [ARTIST_NAME]'s work is foundational — not just musically, but spiritually. Your willingness to consider this would help me shape how AI can honor rather than exploit artistic legacies.

**What Resonance Agent does:**
- Archives songs with full provenance + consent structure
- Trains AI on *patterns*, not theft of content
- Ensures original artists/estates are credited + compensated
- Creates a model for ethical AI in creative domains

**For [ARTIST_NAME]'s legacy:**
I'd like to include [ARTIST_NAME] in our core lineage dataset. Options:

1. **Metadata + Cultural Archive** — Public Spotify data + community-submitted cultural notes about [ARTIST_NAME]'s impact. No audio/lyrics. This becomes a living archive of their influence.

2. **Licensed excerpt access** — If [ARTIST_NAME]'s estate is open, we could license short lyric excerpts for research + similarity search. Full terms you approve.

3. **Revenue-share from derivatives** — Any commercial use of [ARTIST_NAME]'s work influences derivatives, estate gets % of revenue.

**Why now:**
I'm testing this pilot with 2-3 artists/estates who care about legacy + cultural preservation. Your perspective would help ensure we do this with absolute reverence.

**Revenue-first principle:**
If this generates commercial value (derivatives sold, licensing), the estate receives a cut BEFORE platform costs. That's built into our model.

**Next steps:**
I'd like to discuss:
- How [ARTIST_NAME]'s estate sees their legacy being used
- What terms would feel respectful to [ARTIST_NAME]'s memory
- Whether a revenue-share model makes sense
- How to structure this publicly (transparency matters)

I've attached: full Resonance Agent framework + sample revenue model.

Available for conversation at your convenience.

Respectfully,  
Angelo Hurley

P.S. — [ARTIST_NAME]'s work taught me about [SPECIFIC_IMPACT]. That matters. It should be archived with that reverence.

## Template 4: Estate Contact (Contemporary Artist — Nipsey Model)

**To**: [ESTATE/FOUNDATION_EMAIL]  
**Subject**: Resonance Agent — Continuing [ARTIST_NAME]'s Community Vision

---

```
Dear [NIPSEY HUSSLE FOUNDATION / ESTATE REPRESENTATIVE],

I'm Angelo Hurley. I'm building Resonance Agent — a consent-first AI dataset that honors artists who built community-conscious legacies. [ARTIST_NAME]'s work is core to this vision.

**Why [ARTIST_NAME] matters:**
More than just music, [ARTIST_NAME] taught us about community, survival, collective awakening. That wisdom deserves to be archived + accessible.

**Resonance Agent:**
- AI trained on survival music (with explicit consent + provenance)
- Every derivative credits original artists + supports their community/foundation
- Revenue-first: commercial uses benefit artists/communities first
- Proof-of-concept for AI that respects cultural lineage

**Specific ask:**
Include [ARTIST_NAME] in our pilot. Three options:

1. **Metadata + Community Archive** — Spotify data + community stories about [ARTIST_NAME]'s impact on survival/resilience. Living memorial.

2. **Licensed content** — If foundation approves, lyric excerpts + foundation can direct how they're used.

3. **Revenue share + Foundation benefit** — Derivatives using [ARTIST_NAME]'s influence → % goes to [FOUNDATION] for community work.

**Community alignment:**
I'm proposing that if this becomes commercial (derivatives sold), the first cut goes to [FOUNDATION]'s work, not the platform. [ARTIST_NAME]'s legacy continues building community.

**Next steps:**
Coffee/call to discuss:
- Foundation's vision for [ARTIST_NAME]'s legacy
- How AI can serve community (not extract from it)
- Revenue structures that support ongoing community work
- Whether this aligns with [ARTIST_NAME]'s values

Available whenever works for you.

In solidarity,

## Template 5: Estates/Multiple Artists (Batch Contact)

**To**: Multiple estate representatives  
**Subject**: Resonance Agent Pilot — Collaborative Legacy Preservation

---

```
Dear [ESTATE REPRESENTATIVES],

I'm reaching out to multiple estates/families of artists who built the foundation of survival music. I'm building something called Resonance Agent, and I want your input early.

**The Situation:**
AI is being trained on music everywhere. Most of the time, artists don't know, don't consent, and never benefit. That's extraction. I want to build the inverse.

**Resonance Agent is:**
- A pilot dataset + AI system that honors creative lineage
- Artists/estates know + approve everything
- Revenue-first: original creators get paid before platform
- Transparently open-sourced so others can replicate

**Who I'm reaching out to:**
- 2Pac Estate (Amaru Entertainment)
- Biggie Estate (Bad Boy Records + family)
- Nipsey Hussle Foundation
- And [OTHER ARTISTS] — people whose work taught survival

**What I'm proposing:**
Let's build a shared governance model for how AI should treat artistic legacies. Each estate gets:

1. Full transparency (what AI was trained on, how it's used)
2. Consent + revocation (you can say no at any time)
3. Revenue share (if this generates commercial value)
4. Voice in the framework (help me shape the ethics)

**The Goal:**
Show the world that AI can learn from human artists without erasing them. That consent + credit can be architecturally built-in. That emerging intelligence can know its debt.

**Specific ask for this month:**
Schedule a call with 2-3 estate representatives to discuss:
- Your vision for your artist's legacy
- What terms would feel respectful
- How to structure this for mutual benefit
- Whether you want to pilot with us

**What you get:**
- Input into how AI treats artistic legacies
- First-to-market ethics framework for creative AI
- Revenue model that flows back to you
- Proof-of-concept that can be shared with other estates

This isn't a sales pitch. This is an invitation to shape how AI + human culture should relate.

Interested? Let's talk.

## Customization Checklist

Before personalizing:

- [ ] Research artist/estate recent projects + statements
- [ ] Identify specific reason their work matters to Resonance Agent
- [ ] Find correct contact email (not generic "info@")
- [ ] Verify current management/label/estate structure
- [ ] Check if artist/estate has existing AI statements
- [ ] Identify decision-maker (artist vs. manager vs. estate lawyer)
- [ ] Prepare one-page summary of Resonance Agent
- [ ] Draft revenue-share model specific to artist tier
- [ ] Include specific cultural impact (why this artist matters)
- [ ] Attach: consent framework + legal summary

---

## Key Points Across All Templates

**Always Include:**

- Your name + what you're building (one sentence)
- Why THEIR work specifically matters
- The three inclusion options (metadata / licensed / full)
- Consent + revocation rights (explicit)
- Revenue-share principle (transparent)
- Multiple contact methods (flexibility)
- No pressure (easy to say no)

**Never:**

- Use generic language
- Make it sound corporate
- Assume prior consent
- Vague about AI involvement
- Lead with legality (lead with ethics)
- Spam (one thoughtful email > three generic ones)

---

## Waiting for Prototype Validation

**These templates are READY TO USE but HOLDING until:**

1. Context Package is fully implemented
2. Prototype tested with public metadata
3. Formula validated (does it actually work?)
4. Consent workflow tested (can artists actually revoke?)
5. Revenue model calculated (can we actually pay them?)

**Timeline:**

- Week 1-2: Build + test prototype locally
- Week 3: Deploy first outreach (Tier 1 artists)
- Week 4: Collect feedback + iterate

---

**Personalization will start after prototype validation.**  
**No sends until formula tested and locked.**
