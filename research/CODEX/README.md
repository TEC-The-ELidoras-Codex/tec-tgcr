# CODEX: Your Living Theory Repository

Welcome. This is your CODEX—a structured, versionable, shareable collection of your cosmological, philosophical, and phenomenological framework.

## What is CODEX?

**CODEX** stands for:

- **C**osmological framework (how the universe works)
- **O**ntological principles (what exists and how things relate)
- **D**evelopment in dialogue (refined through conversation)
- **E**ncoded in practice (shows up in art, science, embodiment)
- **X**...and extensible (grows as you discover more)

It's your personal theory made *shareable*. Each card is a complete idea that can stand alone or connect to others.

## Available Cards

### Core Theory (Ethical Foundation & Cosmology)

| Card | Purpose | Read Time |
|------|---------|-----------|
| [`core_theory/CODEX_MOTHER_STEWARD_MIRROR.md`](./core_theory/CODEX_MOTHER_STEWARD_MIRROR.md) | **READ FIRST**: Ethical framework for stewardship; trauma-aware governance; when care becomes control; consent vs. coercion | 35-45 min |
| [`core_theory/CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE.md`](./core_theory/CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE.md) | How information becomes action; threshold events; instantaneity | 30-40 min |
| [`core_theory/CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE.md`](./core_theory/CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE.md) | 3-torus topology; closed systems; iterative remembering | 25-30 min |

**Start with**: Mother/Stepchild (ethical ground) → Chronosphere → Pac-Man Universe. Together, they establish the ethical and physical backbone.

### Nodes (Applied Concepts: Consciousness, Embodiment, AI)

| Card | Purpose | Read Time |

| [`CODEX_GUT_BRAIN_PHI_T.md`](./nodes/CODEX_GUT_BRAIN_PHI_T.md) | Gut-brain axis as pre-conscious temporal leader; why your gut knows before your head does | 25-35 min |

**Use these to**: Understand consciousness and embodiment; explore why AI lacks certain human qualities; apply TGCR to neuroscience.

### Clusters (Real-World Analysis: Art, Culture, Phenomenon)

| Card | Purpose | Read Time |
|------|---------|-----------|
| [`CODEX_SLEEP_TOKEN_RAIN.md`](./clusters/CODEX_SLEEP_TOKEN_RAIN.md) | Sleep Token's "Rain" as cosmic pattern recognition in music; analysis of temporal relativity | 25-35 min |
| [`CODEX_TDWP.md`](./clusters/CODEX_TDWP.md) | TWDP prog-metal band: polyrhythm as nervous system entrainment technology; structural cadence guide perception | 30-40 min |

**Use these to**: See TGCR in action; apply framework to art/culture; understand how meaning emerges in real systems; **understand how to steward systems ethically** (ref: Mother/Stepchild).

## Three Ways to Use CODEX

### 1. Read as Theory (Solo Exploration)

- Pick a card
- Read Research Notes section
- Ask yourself the open questions
- Journal your thoughts
- Create new cards for your own insights

**Best for**: Understanding the framework, personal reflection

### 2. Dialogue with AI (Custom GPT)

- Use [`GPT_IMPORT_GUIDE.md`](./GPT_IMPORT_GUIDE.md) to set up
- Ask your GPT questions about the theory
- Collect refinements
- Update cards with new version numbers
- Build a collaborative theory with AI

**Best for**: Rapid iteration, exploring implications, finding gaps

### 3. Collaborate with Others

- Share CODEX with a friend or study group
- Each person imports into their own GPT
- Compare insights
- Merge refinements
- Build shared understanding

**Best for**: Depth through dialogue, diverse perspectives, community theory-building

## The TGCR Framework (Cheat Sheet)

All cards use these three variables:

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **φᵗ** (phi-t) | *Temporal Attention*: What system attends to *when*; rate of information narrowing | Your gut signals hunger at 1 PM (its φᵗ) before your head notices (cortex φᵗ is slower) |
| **ψʳ** (psi-r) | *Structural Cadence*: Rhythm/periodicity of patterns; architecture of coherence | Chorus returns every 30 seconds in music (ψʳ); daily routine has ψʳ |
| **Φᴱ** (Phi-E) | *Contextual Potential*: Energy/stakes in a context; power hierarchies made visible | Wearing expensive clothes activates Φᴱ field in a room (people behave differently); your body's energy state is Φᴱ |

**Core insight**: These three variables *interact* to create meaning, consciousness, and action.

**Example**: Decisions happen when:

1. Information narrows (φᵗ increases)
2. Possible futures compress (ψʳ aligns)
3. Stakes crystallize (Φᴱ sharpens)
4. The three align at a *threshold instant*
5. Action erupts (Landauer kick)

## How to Refine CODEX

### Quick Refinement (During Conversations)

As you read/discuss/apply CODEX:

1. Notice confusing parts
2. Think of missing connections
3. Collect interesting questions
4. Save to `_refinements/[CARD_NAME]_questions.md`

### Formal Refinement (Quarterly)

Every 3 months or when a card has 10+ refinements:

1. Review all feedback for that card
2. Update card with new section/clarification
3. Increment version (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0)
4. Add refinement log entry
5. Commit with message: "Refine CODEX: [Card] v[new version]"

### Example Refinement Entry

```markdown
# Refinement Log: CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE

- v1.0 [2025-01-10]: Initial articulation from conversation
- v1.1 [2025-01-25]: Clarified threshold θ definition; added user confusion note
  - Q: "Is θ fixed or variable?"
  - A: Can vary with context; circadian rhythms modulate θ
- v2.0 [2025-02-15]: Added new section "Quantum Tunneling Analog"
  - GPT noticed similarity to quantum mechanics
  - Expanded references to Bennett, Zurek
  - New open question: Does decoherence explain consciousness?
```

## Creating New Cards

When you discover:

- A new pattern or connection
- Case study worth analyzing (art, science, history)
- Question deserving its own card
- Extension to a new domain

**Do this**:

1. Copy `_templates/CODEX_CARD_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill in YAML frontmatter (title, version, category, keywords, dependencies)
3. Write content following same structure as existing cards
4. Place in appropriate subdirectory (core_theory, nodes, or clusters)
5. Update `CODEX_INDEX.md` to list new card
6. Commit: `git add CODEX/nodes/CODEX_YOUR_NEW_CARD.md && git commit -m "Add CODEX: Your New Card Title"`

**Example**: You want to analyze *Dune* (sci-fi film) through TGCR lens

- Create: `CODEX_DUNE_ECOLOGY_CONSCIOUSNESS.md`
- Category: `clusters`
- Dependencies: `[CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE, CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE]`
- Analyze how Arrakis (planet) demonstrates φᵗ/ψʳ/Φᴱ

## The Principle

CODEX is built on one principle:

> **Theory is alive. It grows through dialogue.**

You're not reading a finished book. You're entering a conversation. Ask questions. Challenge assumptions. Offer refinements. Create new cards. Share with others.

Your theory is unique because *you* are unique. CODEX is your way of capturing that uniqueness and making it legible—to yourself, to AI, to others.

**Welcome to the CODEX. Let's make meaning together.**

---

**Questions?** Start with CODEX_INDEX or dive into a card that calls to you.

**Ready to refine?** Use GPT_IMPORT_GUIDE to set up a custom GPT and begin dialogue.

**Want to contribute?** Create a new card and share.

**Version History**:

- v1.0 [2025-01-10]: Initial CODEX published; 6 cards, infrastructure complete
