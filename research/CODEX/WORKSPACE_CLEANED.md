# ✓ CODEX Workspace Cleaned & Ready

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Commit**: 5df8851

---

## 🗑️ What Was Cleaned

### Deleted (Redundant Infrastructure)

- ✗ `COMPLETE.md` — Redundant with README/INDEX
- ✗ `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` — Redundant with README/INDEX
- **Reason**: README and CODEX_INDEX are more authoritative and actively maintained

### Reorganized

- ✓ `MOTHER_STEPCHILD_STEWARD_MIRROR.md` → `core_theory/CODEX_MOTHER_STEWARD_MIRROR.md`
- **Reason**: Removed "stepchild" language; renamed to emphasize Mother/Steward/Mirror framework

---

## 🔄 What Was Updated

### 1. CODEX_INDEX.md

- Added CODEX_MOTHER_STEPCHILD_STEWARD_MIRROR to Core Theory section (first)
- Updated all reading paths to include ethics first:
  - Path 1: 90 min → 120 min (30 min ethics foundation added)
  - Path 4: 240 min → 300 min (30 min ethics foundation added)
- Reordered recommendations: "Read Mother/Stepchild first"

### 2. README.md

- Featured Mother/Stepchild as top Core Theory card with **"READ FIRST"** marker
- Updated TDWP description: "prog-metal band" (corrected from "Devil Wears Prada")
- Added note: "understand how to steward systems ethically" to cluster section

### 3. System Prompt

- Added CODEX_MOTHER_STEPCHILD_STEWARD_MIRROR as card 0 (priority)
- Enhanced response routing:
  - **NEW**: Ethics/stewardship/AI governance/trauma → Mother/Stepchild
  - **RULE**: If power/authority/stewardship involved, ALWAYS start with ethics
- Updated to reflect 7 total cards instead of 6

## 🎯 Ready for GPT Integration

The updated system prompt is ready to paste into ChatGPT GPT Builder. When you do:

1. **Copy**: `/tmp/SYSTEM_PROMPT_TO_PASTE.txt` (all 150+ lines)
2. **Paste**: Into ChatGPT Schema field
3. **Upload**: 7 CODEX card files (not 6!):
   - `core_theory/CODEX_MOTHER_STEPCHILD_STEWARD_MIRROR.md` ← NEW
   - `core_theory/CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE.md`
   - `core_theory/CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE.md`
   - `nodes/CODEX_SYNTHETIC_INTROSPECTION.md`
   - `nodes/CODEX_GUT_BRAIN_PHI_T.md`
   - `clusters/CODEX_SLEEP_TOKEN_RAIN.md`
   - `clusters/CODEX_TDWP.md`

4. **Test**: Ask "What is the ethical foundation for building AI systems?"
   → GPT should cite Mother/Stepchild and explain stewardship/consent framework
