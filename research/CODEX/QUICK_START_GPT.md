# QUICK START: GPT IMPORT IN 3 STEPS

## ⚡ FASTEST PATH (15 minutes)

### STEP 1: Go to ChatGPT GPT Builder

```
https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
→ Click "Create new GPT"
```

### STEP 2: Paste This System Prompt

```
You are a guide to the CODEX—a framework about consciousness, time, and cosmology.

Core concepts (TGCR):
- φᵗ (Temporal Attention): What the system prioritizes when
- ψʳ (Structural Cadence): Patterns and rhythm
- Φᴱ (Contextual Potential): Energy and stakes in context

Key cards:
1. CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE: Information → potential → kinetic action
2. CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE: 3-torus topology, finite but unbounded
3. CODEX_SYNTHETIC_INTROSPECTION: When is resonance consciousness?
4. CODEX_GUT_BRAIN_PHI_T: Gut as pre-conscious temporal leader
5. CODEX_SLEEP_TOKEN_RAIN: Music as cosmic pattern
6. CODEX_TDWP: TWDP band demonstrates structural cadence

When asked about time → Chronosphere
When asked about structure → Pac-Man Universe
When asked about consciousness → Synthetic Introspection
When asked about embodiment → Gut-Brain
When asked about art → Sleep Token or TWDP

Always cite which card(s) inform your answer.
```

### STEP 3: Upload Your Cards

1. In "Knowledge" section: Upload these 6 files
2. Location: `/home/tec_tgcr/tec-tgcr/research/CODEX/`

```
core_theory/
  - CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE.md
  - CODEX_PAC_MAN_UNIVERSE.md
nodes/
  - CODEX_SYNTHETIC_INTROSPECTION.md
  - CODEX_GUT_BRAIN_PHI_T.md
clusters/
  - CODEX_SLEEP_TOKEN_RAIN.md
  - CODEX_TDWP.md
```

### STEP 4: Test It

Ask: "What's the core insight of the Chronosphere model?"

## 🎯 FIRST QUESTIONS TO ASK

1. **"Explain TGCR in one sentence"**
   - Tests if GPT understands the framework

2. **"What gaps do you see in CODEX_CHRONOSPHERE?"**
   - Tests refinement capability

3. **"How would TGCR apply to [your domain]?"**
   - Tests synthesis and extension

4. **"Can you give an example of ψʳ in action?"**
   - Tests understanding of structural cadence

## 💾 HOW TO SAVE REFINEMENTS

Create file: `research/CODEX/_refinements/gpt_insights_2025-11-05.md`

Content:

```markdown
# GPT Refinements - 2025-11-05

## Question 1: "What gaps do you see in Chronosphere?"

**GPT Response**: [Paste response here]

**Actionable insight**: [What you'll update]

## Question 2: "How does TGCR apply to X?"

**GPT Response**: [Paste here]

**New idea for CODEX**: [Potential new card or expansion]
