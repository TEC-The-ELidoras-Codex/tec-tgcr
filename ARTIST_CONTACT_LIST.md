## Contact Strategy (Next Steps)

### Phase 0 Prototype (No Outreach Yet)

1. **Internal testing**: Build working formula with existing public metadata
2. **Identify 1-2 pilot artists**: Recommend Sleep Token + Nipsey Hussle Foundation (both accessible + aligned)
3. **Prepare materials**: Finalize outreach emails + consent forms before sending

### Phase 1 Outreach (When Ready)

**Tier 1 (Try First):**

- Sleep Token (contemporary, philosophical)
- I See Stars (independent, experimental)
- Nipsey Hussle Foundation (community-aligned)

**Tier 2 (If Tier 1 succeeds):**

- Kendrick Lamar (through pgLang)
- Trivium (through AWAL)
- Silverstein (through Shane Told direct approach)

**Tier 3 (Complex, requires legal):**

- 2Pac Estate (Amaru Entertainment)
- Biggie Estate (Bad Boy Records + family lawyers)

### Contact Protocol (General)

1. **Research first** — verify current management/estate structure
2. **Multi-channel approach** — official site + social media + label
3. **Personalize each inquiry** — show you know their work + lineage
4. **Lead with philosophy** — explain Resonance Agent's ethical framework
5. **Offer options** — metadata-only first, upgrade if interested
6. **No pressure** — make it easy to say no + revoke later

## Red Flags & Considerations

⚠️ **Avoid:**

- Spamming; multiple contacts same artist
- Vague generic pitches
- Legal language without relationship first
- Assuming consent from past sampling
- Underestimating estate complexity

✅ **Do:**

- Research their specific work + values
- Mention Resonance Agent's consent-first framework
- Offer multiple permission levels
- Be transparent about AI involvement
- Show revenue-share willingness

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] Verify current management contacts for Tier 1 artists
- [ ] Prepare one-page Resonance Agent summary for artist outreach
- [ ] Build prototype with Sleep Token + Kendrick metadata (public sources only)
- [ ] Draft personalized email for each pilot artist
- [ ] **DO NOT SEND** until prototype tested + formula validated
- [ ] Once formula works, deploy Tier 1 outreach

---

**Last Updated**: November 3, 2025  
**Ready for Prototype**: YES — waiting for outreach template finalization  
**Timeline**: Prototype testing (1-2 weeks) → Tier 1 outreach (Week 3-4)
