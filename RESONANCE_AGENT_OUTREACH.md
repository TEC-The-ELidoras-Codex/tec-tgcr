# Resonance Agent — Artist Outreach + Consent Templates

## Overview

These are **send-ready templates** for inviting artists, labels, and fans to participate in the Resonance Agent pilot. Customize the artist/label name and contact details; the core message respects consent, credits, and revenue-sharing.

---

## Template 1: Initial Artist Outreach (Friendly, Indie-First)

**Subject**: Quick note — Resonance Agent pilot + honoring your music

**Body**:

```
Hi [Artist Name / Band Name / Management Team],

My name is Angelo Michael Hurley. I'm building a small pilot called Resonance Agent — 
an AI-driven archive and co-creation platform that maps the cultural lineage of "songs 
of survival."

I grew up on your music. [SPECIFIC TRACK/ALBUM] taught me how to [SPECIFIC EMOTIONAL LESSON].
That's why I'm reaching out.

The premise is simple:
- We archive survival songs with full provenance + artist consent.
- We train AI to recognize *patterns* (motifs, sonic structures, emotional arcs) 
  that make those songs work.
- We help new artists co-create using that lineage, always with credit + revenue-share 
  for original creators.
- We never sample, remix, or suggest without permission.

I'd love to invite [Artist/Band Name] into the pilot. We'll only use your material 
with explicit written consent, offer flexible licensing terms (metadata-only? 
non-commercial remix? revenue-share on commercial derivatives?), and always credit you.

If you're interested, I'd love 15 minutes to explain the platform and share a demo. 
I'm happy to run through our consent + revenue-sharing model and answer any concerns.

Thank you for the music—it matters.

## Template 2: Label/Management Outreach (Rights-Focused)

**Subject**: Resonance Agent — Pilot partnership + artist collaboration opportunity

**Body**:

```
Hi [Label/Management Name],

My name is Angelo Michael Hurley. I'm developing Resonance Agent, an AI research 
platform that maps the cultural lineage of survival songs + enables ethical co-creation 
with new artists.

I'm reaching out because [Artist Name]'s work [SPECIFIC ALBUM] exemplifies the motifs 
we're studying: [MOTIFS: survival, ritual, cosmic seeking, mother-longing, etc.].

We're building a pilot that:
1. Archives music with full artist + label consent.
2. Uses AI to identify sonic/thematic patterns (not to replace artists, but to help 
   new artists *learn* from the lineage).
3. Generates derivatives *only* with explicit permission and revenue-sharing agreements.

For [Artist/Label Name], this means:
- Your music gets credited + discovered by new audiences (through our "Line of Succession" 
  playlist + co-creation demos).
- If a derivative uses your material, you receive revenue share or micro-payments.
- You control the terms: metadata-only? non-commercial remix rights? commercial revenue-share?
- You can revoke consent anytime.

I'm happy to discuss flexible licensing terms, NDAs, and a pilot agreement. Can we 
schedule 20 minutes to talk?

## Template 3: Fan/Community Contributor Outreach

**Subject**: Help us honor the songs of survival — Resonance Agent pilot

**Body**:

```
Hey [Friend / Community / Discord / Subreddit],

I'm building something called Resonance Agent — a music archive + AI co-creation 
platform that honors the songs that taught us survival.

I want to include *your* voice. Here's what I mean:

What song changed your life? What survival hymn got you through? Why does it matter?

I'm collecting short contributions from fans:
- [Song title] by [Artist]
- Why it matters to you (2–3 sentences)
- Your name or anonymous (you choose)

We'll include your contribution in the Resonance Agent archive + credit you as a 
cultural curator. Your note helps new artists (and AI) understand what makes these 
songs sacred.

Contribute here: [GOOGLE FORM LINK]

(We keep your data private unless you opt-in to be credited publicly. No selling, 
no sneaky use.)

Thanks for being part of this.

— Angelo

## Template 4: Spotify Playlist Invitation (to Share)

**Subject**: "Line of Succession" — Your music is in our pilot archive

**Body**:

```
Hi [Artist Name],

We've created a public Spotify playlist called "Line of Succession — Songs That Taught 
Me to Survive." Your track [SONG TITLE] is featured because it's part of the survival 
lineage we're studying.

The playlist is 100% credit-driven: every song includes artist + label info + a link 
to the full Resonance Agent archive.

Feel free to:
- Share the link with your fans (it drives discovery).
- Opt-out if you'd prefer (just reply and we'll remove it immediately).
- Suggest 2–3 songs that should be on there (we'll add them and credit you as curator).

Link: [PLAYLIST LINK]

Hope it resonates.

— Angelo

## Template 5: Advisory Board Invitation

**Subject**: Resonance Agent — Join our governance board (musicians, lawyers, ethicists)

**Body**:

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building Resonance Agent — an AI platform that trains on survival songs with 
absolute reverence for artist consent + lineage.

We're assembling a small advisory board of musicians, music lawyers, and ethicists 
to guide the platform's governance. I'd like to invite you.

Advisory board role:
- Quarterly calls (1 hour) to review: consent disputes, contentious AI generations, 
  revenue-share fairness, cultural concerns
- Help set policy on sampling, interpolation, and cultural respect
- Approve / reject borderline use cases
- Represent your community's interests (musicians, lawyers, ethicists, or other)

Commitment: ~2 hours/quarter, no compensation (but we can discuss honorarium 
depending on resources).

Interested? Let's chat.

— Angelo

## Guiding Principle

Every template above is built on **reverence**: we ask first, we credit always, we share revenue fairly.
Artists will consent because this system proves AI can respect human culture.

Let's do this sacred work.
